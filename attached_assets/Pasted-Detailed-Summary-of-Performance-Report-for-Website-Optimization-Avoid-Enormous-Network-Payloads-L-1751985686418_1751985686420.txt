Detailed Summary of Performance Report for Website Optimization:

Avoid Enormous Network Payloads (LCP Issue):
Problem: Total page size is 49.5MB, dominated by large images (e.g., upload_1751324989610.jpeg - 4.21MB, upload_1751324509723.jpeg - 3.66MB, etc.), causing slow load times and high data costs for users.
Action:
Compress images using tools like ImageOptim or TinyPNG.
Convert images to modern formats (e.g., WebP) for smaller file sizes.
Implement responsive images with srcset to serve smaller images for mobile devices.
Use a CDN to reduce latency for image delivery.
Reduce JavaScript Execution Time (TBT Issue):
Problem: 1.5s spent on JavaScript execution, with significant CPU usage (e.g., index-CIgQfGRl.js - 2.1s total CPU time, 669ms script evaluation).
Action:
Minify and bundle JS files to reduce parsing and execution time.
Defer non-critical JS using defer or async attributes.
Remove unused code with tools like Webpack or Rollup.
Optimize third-party scripts (e.g., Google Tag Manager, Facebook Pixel) by loading them asynchronously or reducing their scope.
Avoid Long Main-Thread Tasks (TBT Issue):
Problem: 20 long tasks identified, with the longest from index-CIgQfGRl.js (518ms) and Cloudflareâ€™s rocket-loader.min.js (322ms), causing input delays.
Action:
Break down large JS tasks into smaller, asynchronous chunks using Web Workers.
Prioritize critical rendering path by inlining essential JS and deferring non-essential scripts.
Audit third-party scripts (e.g., googletagmanager.com, connect.facebook.net) for necessity and optimize their execution.
Set Explicit Width and Height on Image Elements (CLS Issue):
Problem: Two images (LogoOSE100anos.png) lack explicit width and height, causing layout shifts and poor Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
Action:
Add width and height attributes to <img> tags (e.g., <img src="/images/LogoOSE100anos.png" width="100" height="100" alt="OSE - 100 Anos">).
Ensure aspect ratios are maintained with CSS (e.g., aspect-ratio: 100 / 100).
Use loading="lazy" for non-critical images to improve CLS.
Preload Largest Contentful Paint Image (LCP Issue):
Problem: The LCP image (horizontal_4.png) causes a 738ms delay due to dynamic loading.
Action:
Add a preload tag in the <head>: <link rel="preload" as="image" href="/images/horizontal_4.png">.
Ensure the LCP image is optimized (compressed and in WebP format) to reduce load time.
Page Details:
Problem:
Fully loaded time: 6.9s.
Total page size: 49.4MB (48MB images, 1.15MB JS, 157KB fonts, 34.4KB CSS).
95 requests (38.9% images, 20% JS, 4.2% CSS/HTML).
Action:
Reduce total requests by consolidating CSS/JS files and sprite images.
Optimize web fonts by limiting font families and using font-display: swap.
Implement lazy loading for off-screen images using loading="lazy".
Minimize third-party requests (e.g., Google Tag Manager, Facebook Pixel) by evaluating their necessity.
Additional Recommendations:

JavaScript Optimization: Excessive JS usage impacts performance. Audit and remove unused scripts, and consider code-splitting for faster initial loads.
Third-Party Scripts: Third-party scripts (e.g., Google Tag Manager, Facebook) contribute to delays. Load them asynchronously or conditionally based on user interaction.
Performance Monitoring: Set up continuous monitoring with tools like GTmetrix or Lighthouse to track improvements and regressions.
